### British Airways software failure

Occurring multiple times within the same year, the British Airways had experienced crashed software in that flight statuses weren’t updated on time, forcing 75,000 passengers to have delayed, or cancelled flights - mostly international. The primary reasons for the previously unresolved incident was that the flight agency’s software wasn’t tested too often, and hardly any employee held responsible for resolving the issue.
